##Dotfiles for my XPS-13 (9343)

##Setup
* Distro: `arch`
* Window Manager: `i3`
* Bar: `i3blocks`
* Launcher: `rofi`
* Compositor: `compton`
* Shell: `zsh`
* Terminal Emulator: `rxvt-unicode`
* Editor: `vim`
* Music Player: `ncmpcpp`
* File Manager: `thunar`
* Browser: `firefox`
* Email Client: `thunderbird`

To keep these organized, I keep them all in a directory ~/dotfiles and use GNU Stow to symlink everything to the correct place.
